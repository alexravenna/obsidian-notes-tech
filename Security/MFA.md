# Description
- When at least one additional factor is needed for [[authentication]] on top of a username and password
- The additional factors belong to one of three categories:
	- Something the user knows (e.g. a challenge question)
	- Something the user has (e.g. an SMS or [[authenticator app]] code)
	- Something the user is (e.g. biometric properties - fingerprint, face scan)
