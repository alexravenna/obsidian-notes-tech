# Description
- A web page's [[HTML]] is rendered entirely on the server and not in the client's [[browser]]
- General advantages over [[CSR]]:
	- Faster load times in the browser, since it just needs to display the content
	- More [[SEO]]-friendly since the full HTML content can be [[Web crawler|crawled]]
