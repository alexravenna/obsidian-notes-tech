- A subscription is necessary to create and use [[Azure]] services
- A subscription belongs to an account
- Multiple subscriptions can belong to one account
- Subscriptions can be separated along two boundaries:
	- Billing: separate billing reports and invoices per subscription
	- Access control: access-management policies apply on a subscription basis, so you can segregate according to user access
- [[Resource|Resource groups]] always belong to one subscription
