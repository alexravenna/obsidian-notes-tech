# Description
- Model is trained from input data
- Model can then make useful predictions for new or never-before-seen data
- Predictions are compared to training data
- If there is a large enough error between the two, the model tries to reduce this
# Generative models
- Generate new data similar to training data
- Based on learned probability distribution of existing data
# Discriminative models
- "Discriminates" between different kinds of data instances
- Used to classify or predict labels
- Typically trained on labeled data
- Model learns relationship between features of data points and labels
